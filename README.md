# Axis Model Suite

Reproducible papers and code on fermion structure, gauge completion, and gravity in a scalar–vector field framework.
From six geometric inputs the suite reproduces the full SM fermion spectrum and CKM/PMNS matrices; dynamically
generates the electroweak sector with W/Z masses from a composite orientation scale (v_eff = Zχ·v); and fixes |Vub|
via a parameter-free rank-2 overlap. The quantum completion is BRST-invariant, anomaly-free, and RG-stable up to the
scalar-coherence cutoff (~10^5 GeV), consistent with (g-2) and dilepton-compositeness bounds. The gravitational
extension derives the Einstein–Hilbert term at one loop and predicts environment-dependent G(Φ) with lensing/GW
attenuation—providing falsifiable departures from GR.
