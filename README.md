# axis-model-suite
Reproducible papers and code on fermion structure, gauge completion, and gravity in a scalarâ€“vector field framework; derives the full SM fermion spectrum, CKM/PMNS mixing, and electroweak sector from geometry; establishes quantum consistency (BRST, anomalies, RG); extends to emergent gravity with testable deviations from GR.
