# Axis Model Suite

Reproducible papers and code on fermion structure, gauge completion, and gravity in a scalar–vector field framework.
From six geometric inputs the suite reproduces the full SM fermion spectrum and CKM/PMNS matrices; dynamically
generates the electroweak sector with W/Z masses from a composite orientation scale (v_eff = Zχ·v); and fixes |Vub|
via a parameter-free rank-2 overlap. The quantum completion is BRST-invariant, anomaly-free, and RG-stable up to the
scalar-coherence cutoff (~10^5 GeV), consistent with (g-2) and dilepton-compositeness bounds. The gravitational
extension derives the Einstein–Hilbert term at one loop and predicts environment-dependent G(Φ) with lensing/GW
attenuation—providing falsifiable departures from GR.

## Contents

- **papers/** — PDFs of the four main works:
  - [*The Axis Model*](The_Axis_Model.pdf) — lays out the foundational postulates of the scalar–vector framework and shows how geometric tri-vector composites reproduce charge, mass, and spin without extra dimensions or hidden particles.  
  - [*Standard Model Fermion Sector from Internal Tri-Vector Geometry*](The_Standard_Model_Fermion_Sector.pdf) — derives the full fermion spectrum and CKM/PMNS mixing matrices from just six geometric parameters, achieving sub-percent precision across most observables.  
  - [*Quantum Completion of the Axis Model*](Axis_Model_Quantum_Completion.pdf) — demonstrates that the theory is a consistent EFT: BRST-invariant, anomaly-free, renormalization-stable up to ΛΦ ≈ 10⁵ GeV, and compatible with precision (g-2) and compositeness bounds.  
  - [*Quantum Gravitational Extension of the Axis Model*](Quantum_Gravitational_Extension.pdf) — derives the Einstein–Hilbert term from one-loop dynamics, reinterprets black hole interiors as scalar-incoherent domains, and predicts falsifiable deviations from GR such as environment-dependent G(Φ) and gravitational wave attenuation.
